### Notes

I use Xfce4 DE with i3wm as its window manager. My keyboard shortcuts are based
on the Colemak keyboard layout.

Shell: `zsh` (from Ubuntu Jammy repositories)

Keyboard Layout: Colemak

Distribution: GNU/Linux Xubuntu 22.04

License: GPL 3.0

Wallpaper: ![](https://gruvbox-wallpapers.pages.dev/wallpapers/anime/wall.jpg) I
acquired it from [this](https://github.com/AngelJumbo/gruvbox-wallpapers)
repository.

### Documentation

Visit [this site](https://myxi-dotfiles.pages.dev/) for some documentation on my
setup. Do keep in mind that I made the documentation for myself; there will be
notes there that would make no sense for other people.
