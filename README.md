### Wallpaper

I acquired it from [this](https://github.com/AngelJumbo/gruvbox-wallpapers)
repository.

### How To Install
You'll have to figure out the dependencies yourself, but I can at least help you 
to properly copy the configuration files.
```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch main --single-branch \
    https://github.com/eeriemyxi/dotfiles \ 
    ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow .
```
You'll need to install GNU Stow on your system.

### [Documentation](https://myxi-dotfiles.pages.dev/)
Visit [this site](https://myxi-dotfiles.pages.dev/) for some documentation on my
setup. Do keep in mind that I made the documentation for myself; there will be
notes there that would make no sense to other people. _But_ you'll likely want to
read at least the Xfce section if you choose to install my dotfiles on your system.
