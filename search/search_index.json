Theme Not Applying on Login Screen See this answer on Stack Exchange. Resolving Issues with File Permissions You are likely to have issues with file permissions somewhere in the process. I resolve them by manually copying the relevant files to these locations: /usr/share/themes /usr/share/icons /usr/share/wallpapers /usr/share/lightdm/avatars NOTE : The last directory does not exist by default so you will have to manually make it. EXAMPLE : sudo cp ~/.themes/gruvbox-theme/ /usr/share/themes/gruvbox-theme/ -r Sticky Keys You might get nagging notifications about Stick Keys getting enabled. This is how I resolve them: Open Accessibility settings then turn on Stick Keys manually, then turn it off. Uncheck xfce4-settings-helper from Notifications settings' Applications section.
